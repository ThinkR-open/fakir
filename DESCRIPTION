Description: Create fake datasets that can be used for prototyping and teaching.
    This package provides a set of functions to generate fake data
    for a variety of data types, such as dates, addresses,
    and names. It can be used for prototyping (notably in 'shiny') or as a tool
    to teach data manipulation and data visualization.
