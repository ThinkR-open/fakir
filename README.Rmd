The goal of {fakir} is to provide fake datasets that can be used to teach R.  

The full documentation is in this {pkgdown} site: <https://thinkr-open.github.io/fakir/>

## Characteristics

This package is designed for teaching data wrangling and data visualisation:

- some datasets follow the tidy-data principles, others don't. 
- Some missing values are set for numeric and categorical variables
- Some variables values are correlated

These datasets are suitable to introduce to the {tidyverse} and to provide examples for main functions.  
Supported languages are, for now, French and US English.

## Examples

### Fake support ticket base : 

- All tickets

```{r}
library(fakir)
fake_ticket_client(vol = 10)
```

- Separate tickets and client databases

```{r}
tickets_db <- fake_ticket_client(vol = 100, split = TRUE)
tickets_db
ggplot(tickets_db$clients) +
  aes(entry_date, fidelity_points) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
ggplot(tickets_db$tickets) + aes(type) + geom_bar()
ggplot(tickets_db$tickets) + aes(state) + geom_bar()
```

- Join with internal {sf} spatial dataset

```{r}
clients_map <- tickets_db$clients %>% 
  group_by(id_dpt) %>% 
  summarise(
    number_of_clients = n(),
    average_fidelity = mean(fidelity_points, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  full_join(fra_sf, by = "id_dpt") %>% 
  st_sf()

ggplot(clients_map) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = average_fidelity)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  coord_sf(
    crs = 2154,
    datum = 4326
  )
```

### Fake products

- Create a fake dataset of connected wearables

```{r}
fake_products(10)
```


### Fake website visits

```{r}
fake_visits(from = "2017-01-01", to = "2017-01-31")
```

### Fake questionnaire on mean of transport / goal

- All answers

```{r}
fake_sondage_answers(n = 10)
```

- Separate individuals and their answers
```{r}
fake_sondage_answers(n = 10, split = TRUE)
```

### fake transport use

```{r}
answers <- fake_sondage_answers(n = 30)
answers

ggplot(answers) + aes(age, log(distance_km), colour = type) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + facet_wrap(~type, scales = "free_y")
```

## Prior work 

This package is heavily inspired by [{charlatan}](https://github.com/ropensci/charlatan).

## Contribute 

You can contribute to {fakir} in two ways: 

### Translate 

You can translate to other locales by providing : 

+ new `vec` in "R/utils"
+ new `local` in "R/fake_client" and "R/fake_transport"

### New dataset

Feel free to create new datasets generators.
