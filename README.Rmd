# fakir

The goal of {fakir} is to provide fake datasets that can be used to teach R.  

As it is designed for teaching data wrangling and data visualisation, some datasets follow the tidy-data principles, other don't. 

Supported languages are, for now, French and US English.

## Example

### Fake support ticket base : 

- All tickets
```{r}
library(fakir)
fake_ticket_client(vol = 10)
```

- Separate tickets and client databases
```{r}
tickets_db <- fake_ticket_client(vol = 100, split = TRUE)
tickets_db
ggplot(tickets_db$clients) +
  aes(entry_date, fidelity_points) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
ggplot(tickets_db$tickets) + aes(type) + geom_bar()
ggplot(tickets_db$tickets) + aes(state) + geom_bar()
```


### Fake visits : 

```{r}
fake_visits(from = "2017-01-01", to = "2017-01-31")
```

### Fake questionnaire on mean of transport / goal

- All answers

```{r}
fake_sondage_answers(n = 10)
```

- Separate individuals and their answers
```{r}
fake_sondage_answers(n = 10, split = TRUE)
```

### fake transport use

```{r}
answers <- fake_sondage_answers(n = 30)
answers

ggplot(answers) + aes(age, log(distance_km), colour = type) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + facet_wrap(~type, scales = "free_y")
```
