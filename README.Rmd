# fakir

The goal of {fakir} is to provide fake datasets that can be used to teach R.  

As it is designed for teaching data wrangling and data visualisation, some datasets follow the tidy-data principles, other don't. 

Supported languages are, for now, French and US English.

## Example

### Fake support ticket base : 

```{r}
library(fakir)
fake_support_tickets(vol = 10)
```

### Fake visits : 

```{r}
fake_visits(from = "2017-01-01", to = "2017-01-31")
```
